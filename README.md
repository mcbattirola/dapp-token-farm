# üßë‚Äçüåæ Dapp Token Farm

## About
A DAI staking token farm with an React front-end.
The contract owner receives mDAI (a mock DAI implementation) tokens and can issue DAPP tokens as rewards.
The code includes the contracts (Solidity code), as well as an React front-end application to interact with it.
It also includes scripts to deploy and test the contracts.

The objective of this project is to learn about **Solidity** and **blockchain** development, it's not meant to be production code.

### Features
- Stake mDAI (mock DAI) tokens
- Unstake mDAI tokens
- The contract owner can issue DAPP tokens to reward stakers.
